        <h2>After being infected with COVID-19, when do I know that I have recovered?</h2>
        <p>For the confirmed cases with no symptoms, recovery will be after at least 10 days have passed since the first positive sample was taken. As to the confirmed cases with the presence of symptoms, recovery will be after at least 10 days have passed since the symptoms appeared, provided that at least 3 days have passed without respiratory symptoms and a high fever (without using antipyretic medication).

After that, they can go out while maintaining social distancing, wearing a mask and paying attention to personal hygiene.</p>

        <p>Completion of the isolation period and the disappearance of symptoms for the last 3 days are sufficient to confirm recovery. The laboratory test (COVID-19 test) is a means of diagnosis but has no role in recovery.</p>
