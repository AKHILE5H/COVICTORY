      <h3>1. Seek accurate information from legitimate sources</h3>
      <p>Limit yourself to reading information only from official sources like the World Health Organisation (WHO).These credible sources of information are key to avoid the fear and panic that misinformation may cause.Try to watch WHO’s Q&A on mental health during COVID-19</p>

      <h3>2. Set limits around news on COVID-19</h3>
      <p>Try to avoid excessive exposure to media coverage. Constant monitoring of news updates and social media feeds about COVID-19 can intensify feelings of worry and distress. WHO advises seeking factual information mainly to take practical steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and loved ones.</p>

      <h3>3. Look after yourself</h3>
      <p>Self-care in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak includes focusing on things you can control (like having good hygiene) instead of those you cannot (stopping the virus). Where possible, maintain your daily routine and normal activities: eating healthy meals, getting enough sleep and doing things that you enjoy. Consider creating a daily routine that prioritise your wellbeing and positive mental health.</p>

      <h3>4. Reach out to others and support people around you</h3>
      <p>Keeping in touch with your friends and family may ease the stress caused by COVID-19. Talking through your concerns and feelings may help you find ways of dealing with challenges. Receiving support and care from others can bring a sense of comfort and stability. Assisting other people in their time of need and reaching out to someone who may be feeling alone or concerned can benefit both the person receiving support as well as the helper.</p>

      <h3>5. Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking</h3>
      <p>Try and focus on things that are positive in your life. WHO recommends to find opportunities to amplify the voices, positive stories and positive images of local people who have experienced the novel coronavirus and have recovered or who have supported a loved one through recovery and are willing to share their experience.</p>

      <h3>6. Acknowledge your feelings</h3>
      <p>It is normal to feel overwhelmed, stressed, anxious or upset, among a wide range of other emotional reactions, in the current situation. Allow yourself time to notice and express what you’re feeling.</p>

      <h3>7. Take time to talk with your children about the COVID-19 outbreak</h3>
      <p>It is equally important to help children cope with stress and protect them from any coronavirus hysteria. Answer their questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that children can understand. Respond to your child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns and give them extra care, attention and support. Reassure your children that they are safe.</p>

      <h3>8. Ask for professional support</h3>
      <p>ollow protection and prevention recommendations provided by qualified health professionals. If all of this does not help, consider reaching out for support by a professional counsellor or peers. Peer support is usually organised on a local or national basis so it is best to start your search with those in your local area so that you can actually talk with someone who knows what is available.</p>
